#Game of Life#

###Purpose###

This project is to be used for a TDD class. It's not meant to have an implementation. 


For the rules and other details on GoL, please visit the [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

###What's next?###

No real roadmap for what to do next with it.  Maybe a build file (ant or maven) maybe not. It currently only displays to the console but it'd be nice to have a UI component that used like a Swing dipslay. 


Pull requests welcome.
